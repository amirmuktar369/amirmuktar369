## 👋 Hi, I'm Bello Muktar

Computer Science Student | Mathematical Thinker | Builder of Constraint Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG)


### 🧠 About Me

I am deeply interested in mathematics, statistics, and scientific computing.

I don’t just use models. I try to understand their structure, their limits, and their hidden assumptions.

Currently, I am developing **Constraint Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG)** — a statistical framework for reconstructing synthetic datasets from high-level statistical descriptors such as:
* Mean.
* Standard Deviation.
* bounds.
* Modal structures.
The goal is to bridge descriptive statistics and generative modeling through rigorous numerical methods.

### 🔬 Current Focus
* Numerical Analysis.
* Probability & Statistics.
* Linear Algebra (spectral methods, matrix decompositions).
* Scientific Computing with Python.
* Algorithmic optimization.
* Reconstruction from constrained statistical moments.

### 🚀 Constraint Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG)
CSDG is a framework that:
* Reconstructs data from statistical constraints.
* Optimizes reconstruction through structured nudging.
* Balances modal stability and distributional accuracy.
* Investigates runtime scaling relationships.
Recent explorations include:
* Randomized nudging optimization (significant speed improvements for larger sized data).
* Empirical runtime–a² relationships.
* Hierarchical reconstruction strategies.
* jumping mechanism and its conditions.
This is an ongoing research-driven project.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* Python.
* NumPy / SciPy.
* Scientific computing workflows.
* Git & GitHub.
* Algorithm design.
* Mathematical modeling.

### 🎯 Long-Term Vision

To contribute something meaningful at the intersection of:
* Mathematics.
* Statistics.
* Artificial Intelligence.
* Synthetic data generation.

I am particularly interested in building frameworks that are:
* Mathematically grounded.
* Computationally efficient.
* Conceptually original.

📌 Philosophy:
“Compression is not about fewer bits — it’s about preserving rank”.

I believe structure is everything.
